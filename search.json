In this workshop, we will go over tools and practices you can employ to ensure that this is the case. Topics will include containerization, bit-for-bit reproduction of software environments, and software design practices for reproducible pipelines.\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nAppendix A of 2104.12522; Reproducible Research License (RRL)"
